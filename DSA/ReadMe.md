# DSA in C

This repo is my journey to learn **Data Structures and Algorithms in C**.  

## Plan

- Start with easy structures like **Dynamic Arrays**  
- Move to **Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues**  
- Gradually learn **Recursion, Sorting, Trees, Graphs**

## How I Learn

1. **Understand** the concept  
2. **Code it** in C from scratch  
3. **Experiment** and try small tasks  
4. **Repeat** and improve  

Each day I try to **build small programs** to really understand how memory, pointers, and the system work in C.
