# Dynamic Array - Day 1

This folder contains my Day 1 exercises on **dynamic arrays in C**.

The goal of this day was to understand:

- How to create a **dynamic array** using `malloc`.
- How to **track size and capacity**.
- How to **resize** the array dynamically with `realloc`.
- How to safely **append elements** and avoid memory issues.

This is part of my journey to **learn, build, and grow** in data structures and system-level programming in C.
