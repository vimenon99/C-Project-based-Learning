# Dynamic Array – Day 2

## What I Learned Today

Today I worked on **enhancing my dynamic array in C**.  

### Tasks Completed:

1. **Insert at Index (`insertAt`)**  
   - Learned how to insert a value at any position in the array.  
   - Practiced **shifting elements** and handling **resizing** with `realloc`.  

2. **Linear Search (`search`)**  
   - Learned how to search for a value in the array.  
   - Practiced **looping through elements** and returning the index if found.
