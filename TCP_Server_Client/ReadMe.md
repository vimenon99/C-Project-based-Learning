# TCP Echo Server & Client (C Programming)

A simple TCP client–server program written in C to understand how socket communication works at a low level.  
Tested on **WSL (Ubuntu)** using `127.0.0.1:65432`.

---

## Overview

This project demonstrates a minimal TCP echo system:
- The **server** listens for incoming connections.
- The **client** connects, sends messages, and receives the same messages back.

It’s meant for hands-on learning — no frameworks, no shortcuts — just raw sockets.
