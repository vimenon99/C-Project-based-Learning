# C Projects

I’ve always been drawn to how systems actually work beneath all the abstractions.  
This repository is my space to explore that curiosity through C programming.
For those who ever come across this repository, programming takes patience and it doesn't has to be a competitive problem solving chaos in a given time range.
Just refer the code, and google keywords, libraries, functions to understand what the code is doing. GPT can be helpful at times but it should not be the primary resource.
I have tried my best to display my understanding with the code comments.

From simple programs to more complex projects, I’m using this to understand how things truly connect
how memory is managed, how processes talk, how data flows across networks, and how systems stay (or break) secure.

Learning by building.  
Breaking to understand.  
Growing through both.
